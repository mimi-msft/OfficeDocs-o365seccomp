# Zero-hour auto purge - protection against spam and malware

## Overview

Zero-hour auto purge (ZAP) is an email protection feature that detects messages with phish, spam, or malware that have already been delivered to your users' inboxes, and then renders the malicious content harmless. How ZAP does this depends on the type of malicious content detected; mail can be zapped due to mail content, URLs, or attachments.
  
ZAP is available with the default Exchange Online Protection that is included with any Office 365 subscription that contains Exchange Online mailboxes.

ZAP is turned on by default, but the following conditions must be met:
  
- **Spam action** is set to **Move message to Junk Email folder**. You can also create a new spam filter policy that applies only to a set of users if you don't want all mailboxes to be screened by ZAP.

- Users have kept their default junk mail settings, and have not turned off junk email protection. (See [Change the level of protection in the Junk Email Filter](https://support.office.com/article/change-the-level-of-protection-in-the-junk-email-filter-e89c12d8-9d61-4320-8c57-d982c8d52f6b) for details about user options in Outlook.) 
  
## How ZAP works

Office 365 updates anti-spam engine and malware signatures in real-time on a daily basis. However, your users might still get malicious messages delivered to their inboxes for a variety of reasons, including if content is weaponized after being delivered to users. ZAP addresses this by continually monitoring updates to the Office 365 spam and malware signatures. ZAP can find and remove previously delivered messages that are already in users' inboxes.

The ZAP action is seamless for the mailbox user; they are not notified if an email message is moved. Message must not be older than 2 days.
  
Allow lists, [mail flow rules](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=722755), and end user rules or additional filters take precedence over ZAP.

**Malware ZAP**
For newly detected malware, ZAP removes attachments from email messages, leaving the body of the message in the user's mailbox. Attachments are removed regardless of the read status of the mail.

Malware ZAP is enabled by default in the Malware Policy. Malware ZAP can be disabled using the **ZapEnabled** parameter of [Set-MalwareFilterPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/antispam-antimalware/set-malwarefilterpolicy?view=exchange-ps), an EOP cmdlet.

**Phish ZAP**
For mail that is identified as phish after delivery, ZAP takes action according to the Spam policy that the user is covered by. If the policy Phish action is set to take action on a mail (Redirect, Delete, Quarantine, Move to Junk) then ZAP will move the message to the Junk mail folder of the user's inbox, regardless of the read status of the mail. If the policy Phish action is not set to take action (Add X-header, Modify subject, No action) then ZAP will not take action on the mail. Learn more about how to [configure your spam filter policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/securitycompliance/configure-your-spam-filter-policies) here.

Phish ZAP is enabled by default in the Spam Policy. Phish ZAP can be disabled using the **PhishZapEnabled** parameter of [Set-HostedContentFilterPolicy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=722758), an EOP cmdlet.
Note: the previous **ZapEnabled** cmdlet parameter which controlled both Phish and Spam ZAP will soon be deprecated. If you have written any scripts which use the ZapEnabled parameter, we recommend updating them to use SpamZapEnabled and PhishZapEnabled. In the transitional period all 3 parameters (ZapEnabled, PhishZapEnabled, and SpamZapEnabled) will be available through the cmdlet. Until explicitly set via UI or PowerShell, PhishZapEnabled and SpamZapEnabled will show an inherited value from the ZapEnabled parameter. Once the new parameters are set, they will no longer inherit from the ZapEnabled parameter. After it is deprecated, setting ZapEnabled will have no affect on the PhishZapEnabled or SpamZapEnabled properties and ZapEnabled will be removed from the list of parameters in cmdlets.

**Spam ZAP**
For mail that is identified as spam after delivery, ZAP takes action according to the Spam policy that the user is covered by. If the policy Spam action is set to take action on a mail (Redirect, Delete, Quarantine, Move to Junk) then ZAP will move the message to the Junk mail folder of the user's inbox, if the message is unread. If the policy Spam action is not set to take action (Add X-header, Modify subject, No action) then ZAP will not take action on the mail. Learn more about how to [configure your spam filter policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/securitycompliance/configure-your-spam-filter-policies) here.

Spam ZAP is enabled by default in the Spam Policy. Spam ZAP can be disabled using the **SpamZapEnabled** parameter of [Set-HostedContentFilterPolicy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=722758), an EOP cmdlet.
Note: the previous **ZapEnabled** cmdlet parameter which controlled both Phish and Spam ZAP will soon be deprecated. If you have written any scripts which use the ZapEnabled parameter, we recommend updating them to use SpamZapEnabled and PhishZapEnabled. In the transitional period all 3 parameters (ZapEnabled, PhishZapEnabled, and SpamZapEnabled) will be available through the cmdlet. Until explicitly set via UI or PowerShell, PhishZapEnabled and SpamZapEnabled will show an inherited value from the ZapEnabled parameter. Once the new parameters are set, they will no longer inherit from the ZapEnabled parameter. After it is deprecated, setting ZapEnabled will have no affect on the PhishZapEnabled or SpamZapEnabled properties and ZapEnabled will be removed from the list of parameters in cmdlets.

## To see if ZAP moved your message

If you want to see if ZAP moved your message, you can use either the [Threat Protection Status report](view-email-security-reports.md#threat-protection-status-report) or [Threat Explorer (and real-time detections)](threat-explorer.md).

## To disable ZAP
**Disabling Malware ZAP**
To disable Malware ZAP for your O365 tenant, or a set of users, use the **ZapEnabled** parameter of [Set-MalwareFilterPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/antispam-antimalware/set-malwarefilterpolicy?view=exchange-ps), an EOP cmdlet.

In the following example, ZAP is disabled for a content filter policy named "Test".

```Powershell
  Set-HostedContentFilterPolicy -Identity Test -ZapEnabled $false
```
**Disabling Phish and Spam ZAP**
To disable Phish and Spam ZAP for your O365 tenant, or a set of users, use the **PhishZapEnabled** and **SpamZapEnabled** parameters of [Set-HostedContentFilterPolicy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=722758), an EOP cmdlet.

In the following example, phish and spam ZAP are disabled for a content filter policy named "Test".

```Powershell
  Set-HostedContentFilterPolicy -Identity Test -PhishZapEnabled $false -SpamZapEnabled $false
```

## FAQ

### What happens if a legitimate message is moved to the junk mail folder?
  
You should follow the normal reporting process for [false-positives](prevent-email-from-being-marked-as-spam.md). The only reason the message would be moved from the inbox to the junk mail folder would be because the service has determined that the message was spam or malicious.
  
### What if I use the Office 365 quarantine instead of the junk mail folder?
  
ZAP doesn't move messages into quarantine from the Inbox at this time.
  
### What if I have a custom mail flow rule (Block/ Allow Rule)?
  
Rules created by admins (mail flow rules) or Block and Allow rules take precedence. Such messages are excluded from the feature criteria so the mail flow will follow the rule action (Block/Allow Rule).

### What if a message is moved to another folder (e.g. Inbox rule)?
ZAP still works in this case, unless the message has been deleted or is in Junk.
